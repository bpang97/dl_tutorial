# Overview

This repository contains the code examples and prerequisite materials for the hands-on Deep Learning Tutorial at the ISMRM Machine Learning Workshop 2018, as well as instructions for creating a new AWS EC2 GPU instance pre-configured with all the required Python dependencies, CUDA/cudNN libraries and training data for following along the course.

1. How to create a new AWS EC2 instance.
2. How to login and use AWS EC2 instance.  
3. How to run Jupyter notebook.

# Create AWS Instance

# Login to AWS Instance

# Starting Jupyter Notebook 

During the tutorial session, all code written by the participants will be completed using the Jupyter Notebook, an iPython kernel / server that will be running from your own personal AWS instance and accessed through a web-browser. Through this web-based interface one will be able to write, edit and run code in an accessible way without needing to use the Linux command line. For more advanced users, this entire Github repository is available for access from the command line at `~/dl_tutorial`. See below for more information.
