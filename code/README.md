# Overview 

During the tutorial session, all code written by the participants will be completed using the Jupyter notebook, an iPython kernel / server that will be running from your own personal AWS instance and accessed through a web-browser. Through this web-based interface one will be able to write, edit and run code in an easy way without needing to use the Linux command line. For more advanced users, this entire Github repository is available for access from the command line at `~/dl_tutorial`.

To setup and connect to the Jupyter see instructions on home page: https://github.com/peterchang77/dl_tutorial
