    "In this notebook we will cover the basic concepts for training a specific convolutional neural network architecture known as a U-net in TensorFlow. Using this architecture we are able to estimate boundaries of brain tumor tissue types (e.g. segmentation) from multimodal MR images. The data that we will be using in this tutorial comes from the MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BRaTS). More information about he BRaTS Challenge can be found here: http://braintumorsegmentation.org/\n",

    "\n",
    "The U-net is a popular network design under the family of encoder-decoder architectures. In this type of architecture, an encoding (collapsing) arm gradually reduces the spatial dimension with pooling layers (or strided convolutions) while a decoding (expanding) arm gradually recovers the object details and spatial dimension. There are usually shortcut connections from encoder to decoder to help decoder recover the object details better.
