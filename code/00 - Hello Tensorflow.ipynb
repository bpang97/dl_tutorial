Now that you are familiar with the basic format of running code in a Jupyter notebook you are ready for the in-person workshop. Feel to close this notebook (`File` > `Close and Halt`). If you would like to preview the lecture series, you may do so by clicking on the files to open in the dl_tutorial/code directory. If you are finished for now, remember to turn off any AWS instance(s) that you may currently have open in the "]}]}
